You've hit on a very important point! It's easy to get lost in the details of individual script changes. Let's pause and look at the "forest" before we plant more "trees." I'll walk you through my internal thinking process to explain the overall logic flow of what we've built so far and how Airflow and MLflow are *intended* to orchestrate these pieces.

**My Internal Thinking Process to Explain the Current Logic Flow:**

1.  **Identify the "Why":** The core reason for these refactorings is to move from a manual, potentially inconsistent process to an automated, versioned, and monitored MLOps pipeline. This means each script needs to be a well-defined, callable unit that can be managed by an orchestrator.

2.  **Deconstruct into Core Workflows:** I see two primary, interconnected workflows emerging from our design:
    *   **A. The Model Training/Retraining Workflow:** This is the sequence of steps that takes raw data and produces a trained, versioned model.
    *   **B. The Daily Operational Workflow:** This is what runs every day to fetch new data, make predictions with the current best model, and monitor its performance.

3.  **Trace the Data and Artifact Lineage (The `run_id` Story):** The `dataset_run_id` is the thread that ties together a specific version of data through its transformation stages in the *training workflow*.
    *   A specific model, when trained, will be linked to the `dataset_run_id` it used. This link is crucial for reproducibility and debugging.
    *   MLflow will assign its own `mlflow_model_run_id` to each training execution, and we log the `dataset_run_id` as a parameter within that MLflow run.

4.  **Pinpoint Key Decision/Interaction Points:**
    *   How does the system know *when* to retrain? (Answer: The monitoring script in the daily workflow).
    *   How does the daily prediction process know *which model* and *which scalers/features* to use? (Answer: It queries MLflow Model Registry for the "Production" model and then uses the `dataset_run_id` associated with that production model to get the correct scalers/feature definitions).

5.  **Define the Role of Each Tool:**
    *   **Python Scripts:** Encapsulate specific logic (data fetching, feature engineering, training, prediction, monitoring). They are now designed to be callable with parameters (especially `run_id`).
    *   **PostgreSQL:** Acts as our "Offline Feature Store" / "Intermediate Artifact Store." It holds:
        *   `raw_stock_data`: The source of truth for market data.
        *   `processed_feature_data`: Versioned snapshots of data ready for scaling and sequencing (keyed by `dataset_run_id`).
        *   `scaled_feature_sets`: Versioned scaled data (keyed by `dataset_run_id`).
        *   `scalers`: Versioned scalers (keyed by `dataset_run_id`).
        *   `optimization_results`: Versioned best hyperparameters (keyed by `dataset_run_id`).
        *   `latest_predictions`: Stores the most recent predictions for each ticker, along with the `mlflow_model_run_id` of the model that made them. This is for the API and for quick access by the monitoring script.
        *   `model_performance_log`: Historical performance metrics for models, linked to the `mlflow_model_run_id`.
    *   **MLflow:**
        *   **Experiment Tracking:** During `train_model.py`, all parameters (including `dataset_run_id`), metrics, and model artifacts are logged.
        *   **Model Registry:** Trained models are registered. We'll use stages like "Staging" and "Production" to manage model lifecycle. The daily prediction script will load the "Production" model.
        *   **Metadata Source:** Provides information about models, such as the `dataset_run_id` they were trained with (because we logged it as a parameter).
    *   **Airflow (The Orchestrator - How it *will* work):**
        *   **Scheduling:** Runs the "Daily Operational Workflow" on a schedule.
        *   **Task Execution:** Executes our Python scripts as tasks (likely using `BashOperator` to call them with CLI arguments, or `PythonOperator` if we refactor mains into callables).
        *   **Dependency Management:** Defines the order in which tasks run.
        *   **Parameter Passing (XComs):**
            *   When `make_dataset.py --mode full_process` (in the retraining workflow) generates a new `dataset_run_id`, Airflow will capture this (e.g., from its stdout) and pass it to subsequent tasks (`build_features.py`, etc.) as a CLI argument.
            *   When `prepare_prediction_input.py` saves its output to a temp file, Airflow will capture the file path and pass it to `predict_model.py`.
        *   **Branching:** The `monitor_performance.py` script will output a decision (e.g., a task ID). Airflow's `BranchPythonOperator` will use this to decide whether to trigger the "Model Retraining Workflow" or simply end the daily run.
        *   **Triggering Other DAGs:** The daily DAG can trigger the retraining DAG.

6.  **Simplify into a Narrative:** Explain the two workflows as stories.

**Detailed Logic Flow of the Current Implementation (Phases 1 & 2):**

Let's break this down into the two main conceptual pipelines that will eventually be orchestrated by Airflow.

**Pipeline A: The Model Training/Retraining Workflow**
*(This pipeline is run when a new model needs to be trained, either manually triggered or automatically by the monitoring process).*

1.  **Data Ingestion & Full Processing (`src/data/make_dataset.py --mode full_process`):**
    *   **Input:** Configuration from `params.yaml`.
    *   **Action 1 (Raw Data Update):** The `load_data()` function is called. It checks the `raw_stock_data` table in PostgreSQL for the latest entry for each ticker. It then fetches only *newer* data from Yahoo Finance and updates/inserts it into `raw_stock_data`.
    *   **Action 2 (Full Feature Engineering):**
        *   *All* relevant raw data is loaded from the `raw_stock_data` table.
        *   The full sequence of feature engineering steps is applied (technical indicators via `add_technical_indicators()`, preprocessing via `preprocess_data()`, alignment into 3D arrays via `align_and_process_data()`).
        *   A **new unique `DATASET_RUN_ID`** (e.g., `20231105_153000`) is generated.
    *   **Output:**
        *   The engineered features (NumPy arrays for data and targets, list of feature columns, list of tickers) are saved to the `processed_feature_data` table in PostgreSQL, tagged with the new `DATASET_RUN_ID`.
        *   This `DATASET_RUN_ID` is printed to standard output (for Airflow to capture via XComs).

2.  **Feature Scaling & Sequencing (`src/features/build_features.py`):**
    *   **Input:** `params.yaml`, and the `DATASET_RUN_ID` (passed as `--run_id` from the previous step).
    *   **Action:**
        *   Loads the specific processed dataset from `processed_feature_data` using the provided `DATASET_RUN_ID`.
        *   Creates time-series sequences (`create_sequences()`).
        *   Splits into training and testing sets.
        *   Scales the data using `MinMaxScaler` (`scale_data()`).
    *   **Output:**
        *   Scaled data arrays (`X_train_scaled`, `y_train_scaled`, etc.) are saved to the `scaled_feature_sets` table in PostgreSQL, tagged with the *same* `DATASET_RUN_ID`.
        *   The fitted scalers (`scalers_x`, `y_scalers`) are saved to the `scalers` table in PostgreSQL, also tagged with the `DATASET_RUN_ID`.

3.  **Hyperparameter Optimization (`src/models/optimize_hyperparams.py`):**
    *   **Input:** `params.yaml`, and the `DATASET_RUN_ID` (passed as `--run_id`).
    *   **Action:**
        *   Loads the specific scaled training/testing data from `scaled_feature_sets` (using `DATASET_RUN_ID`).
        *   Loads the corresponding `y_scalers` from the `scalers` table (using `DATASET_RUN_ID`).
        *   Runs an Optuna study to find the best hyperparameters for the chosen model architecture(s).
    *   **Output:**
        *   The best hyperparameters (as a JSON string) are saved to the `optimization_results` table in PostgreSQL, tagged with the `DATASET_RUN_ID`.

4.  **Final Model Training & MLflow Logging (`src/models/train_model.py`):**
    *   **Input:** `params.yaml`, and the `DATASET_RUN_ID` (passed as `--run_id`).
    *   **Action:**
        *   Loads the specific scaled training/testing data (`scaled_feature_sets`), `y_scalers` (`scalers`), and best hyperparameters (`optimization_results`), all using the `DATASET_RUN_ID`.
        *   Trains the final model.
        *   **MLflow Interaction:**
            *   An MLflow run is started under the configured experiment name.
            *   The `DATASET_RUN_ID` is logged as a parameter to this MLflow run (e.g., `mlflow.log_param("dataset_run_id", DATASET_RUN_ID)`). This creates the crucial link between the trained model and the exact version of data it used.
            *   Hyperparameters, training/evaluation metrics, and the trained PyTorch model artifact are logged to this MLflow run.
            *   The trained model is **registered** in the MLflow Model Registry (e.g., under a name like "StockPricePredictorLSTM"). Initially, it might be in a "Staging" or "None" stage.
    *   **Output:**
        *   The **MLflow Run ID of this specific training execution** is returned/printed (for Airflow).
        *   (Optional) Predictions made on its internal test set are saved to the `latest_predictions` table in PostgreSQL, tagged with this *model's MLflow Run ID*.

---

**Pipeline B: The Daily Operational Workflow**
*(This pipeline is scheduled to run daily, e.g., after market close).*

1.  **Incremental Raw Data Ingestion (Part of `src/data/make_dataset.py --mode incremental_fetch`):**
    *   **Input:** `params.yaml`.
    *   **Action:** The `load_data()` function checks `raw_stock_data` for the latest data for each ticker and fetches only newer data from Yahoo Finance, updating the `raw_stock_data` table.
    *   **Output:** Updated `raw_stock_data` table in PostgreSQL.

2.  **Get Production Model Information (Conceptual Airflow Task - preparation for next script):**
    *   **Action:** An Airflow task (e.g., a `PythonOperator`) will query the MLflow Model Registry.
    *   It finds the model currently in the "Production" stage (e.g., `models:/StockPricePredictorLSTM/Production`).
    *   It extracts two key pieces of information from this production model's metadata:
        1.  Its **MLflow Model URI** (e.g., `models:/StockPricePredictorLSTM/Production` or a specific version URI like `models:/StockPricePredictorLSTM/5`).
        2.  The **`dataset_run_id`** that was logged as a parameter when *this specific production model version was trained*. (This is why logging `dataset_run_id` in `train_model.py` was vital).
    *   **Output (via Airflow XComs):** The Production Model URI and its associated `dataset_run_id`.

3.  **Prepare Input for Daily Prediction (`src/features/prepare_prediction_input.py`):**
    *   **Input:** `params.yaml`, and the `dataset_run_id` of the *current production model* (from Airflow XComs, passed as `--production_model_training_run_id`).
    *   **Action:**
        *   Loads the `scalers_x` (feature scalers) and `feature_columns` list that were saved under the production model's `dataset_run_id` from the PostgreSQL `scalers` and `processed_feature_data` tables.
        *   Fetches the latest small window of raw data from `raw_stock_data` (using `get_latest_raw_data_window()`).
        *   Applies the *same* technical indicators (`add_technical_indicators()`).
        *   Selects the *same* `feature_columns`.
        *   Takes the most recent `sequence_length` records.
        *   Scales these records using the loaded `scalers_x`.
    *   **Output:** A NumPy array `(1, sequence_length, num_stocks, num_features)` containing the scaled input sequence is saved to a temporary file (e.g., `/tmp/prediction_input.npy`). The absolute path to this file is printed to `stdout` (for Airflow XComs).

4.  **Make Daily Predictions (`src/models/predict_model.py` - refactored):**
    *   **Input:** `params.yaml`, the path to the temporary input sequence file (from Airflow XComs, passed as `--input_sequence_path`), and the Production Model URI (from Airflow XComs, passed as `--production_model_uri`).
    *   **Action:**
        *   Loads the "Production" PyTorch model from the MLflow Model Registry using the provided URI.
        *   Extracts the `dataset_run_id` associated with this loaded production model from its MLflow parameters.
        *   Loads the corresponding `y_scalers` (target variable scalers) from the PostgreSQL `scalers` table using this `dataset_run_id`.
        *   Loads the prepared input sequence from the `.npy` file.
        *   Makes predictions.
        *   Inverse-transforms the scaled predictions using the loaded `y_scalers`.
    *   **Output:**
        *   Predictions are saved to `data/predictions/latest_predictions.json` and `data/predictions/historical/{today_date}.json` (for the API).
        *   Predictions are saved to the `latest_predictions` table in PostgreSQL, tagged with the **MLflow Run ID of the production model** that made them.

5.  **Monitor Model Performance (`src/models/monitor_performance.py`):**
    *   **Input:** `params.yaml`.
    *   **Action:**
        *   Determines the `prediction_date_to_evaluate` (e.g., yesterday, based on `evaluation_lag_days`).
        *   Fetches the predictions made *for* that `prediction_date_to_evaluate` (e.g., from the historical JSON file or by querying the DB if `latest_predictions` table stores target prediction date). It also gets the `model_mlflow_run_id` associated with these predictions.
        *   Fetches the actual closing prices for `prediction_date_to_evaluate` (and the day before for directional accuracy) from the `raw_stock_data` table.
        *   Calculates performance metrics (MAE, MAPE, directional accuracy, etc.).
        *   Saves these metrics to the `model_performance_log` table in PostgreSQL, tagged with the `model_mlflow_run_id` of the model being evaluated.
        *   Compares calculated metrics against the `performance_thresholds` defined in `params.yaml`.
    *   **Output:** Prints a specific string to `stdout` (e.g., `trigger_retraining_pipeline_task` or `no_retraining_needed_task`). Airflow's `BranchPythonOperator` will use this output to decide the next step.

6.  **Branching Logic (Conceptual Airflow Task):**
    *   If `monitor_performance.py` indicates performance is below thresholds, Airflow triggers **Pipeline A (Model Training/Retraining Workflow)**.
    *   Otherwise, the daily operational workflow ends.

---

**How the Pipelines Connect & The "Loop":**

*   The Daily Operational Workflow runs, makes predictions, and monitors.
*   If monitoring detects poor performance, it triggers the Model Training/Retraining Workflow.
*   The Retraining Workflow produces a new candidate model, logs it to MLflow, and (if a separate evaluation/promotion step is added to this workflow, which is good practice) potentially promotes this new, better model to the "Production" stage in MLflow Model Registry.
*   The *next time* the Daily Operational Workflow runs, its "Get Production Model Information" task will pick up this newly promoted "Production" model, and the cycle continues with the updated model.

This structure creates a feedback loop where the system can automatically adapt to changing market conditions or model degradation by retraining and deploying better models. The `dataset_run_id` ensures data lineage for training, and MLflow handles model lineage and deployment staging. PostgreSQL serves as the central hub for versioned data artifacts and operational logs.
